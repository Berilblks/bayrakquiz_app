# Flag Quiz Application (Bayrak Bilgi Yarışması)

**This project is the home screen of a fun and educational quiz application based on guessing the flags of the world, developed using Flutter and Dart.**


##  About the Project

This project aims to create an engaging mobile quiz application focused on identifying flags from around the world. The structure utilizes simple navigation and clear UI elements to provide an accessible learning and testing experience.

* **Quiz Focus:** The core concept involves presenting users with a flag (likely on the `QuizEkrani.dart`) and requiring them to choose the correct corresponding country name from multiple options.
* **Simple Navigation:** The application uses basic Flutter routing (`Navigator.push`) to move the user directly from the welcome screen (`Anasayfa`) to the main quiz environment (`QuizEkrani`).
* **Clear Call-to-Action:** The start screen is designed to quickly onboard the user and initiate the game.


##  Technologies

* **Main Language:**  **Dart** The programming language for logic and UI structure.
* **Framework:** **Flutter SDK** Used for building the cross-platform mobile user interface.
* **Navigation:** **`Navigator`** Responsible for screen transitions between the home page and the quiz.
* **Theme:** **`Material Design (Indigo)`** Utilizes a clean Indigo color palette for the app bar and button styles.
 

##  Key Features

The application's initial screen and assumed overall functionality include the following features:

* **Welcome Screen (`Anasayfa`):** A straightforward welcome page with a bold "QUİZE HOŞGELDİNİZ" title.
* **Game Launch Button:** A prominent "BAŞLA" (START) button to initiate the quiz.
